What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  An empty repository is created.  
  We need a repository so that we can commit version later.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  Staging area is list all the files that need to be tracked and committed to 
  the repository.
  It allows you to specify what files to be committed rather than committing
  all new files.
