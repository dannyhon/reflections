When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I need to share it with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  I may be making changes and do not want my modified files automatically overwritten.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Folks is similar to clone but operate only on GitHub.  Use folks when
    you want to clone another person's repository on GitHub.
  Clone copy the whole repository.  Use this when you want to clone a remote
    repository and make changes in your local environment.
  Branch is a separate path for commits.  Use this when you want to experiment
    something and still keep the main code intact.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  You can pull latest changes from remote and do a merge with your changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  I would need to send an email with my code attached.  GitHub is easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

  Make change to branch will not break code on master that others depend on.  More merges are required and can be complicated.
